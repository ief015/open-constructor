# KOHCTPYKTOP Design save string format

All values formatted as `code` are hexidecimal. Data is little-endian.

# Format

Save data is compressed with zlib and encoded to base64.

Uncompressed data length is varied ([possibly due to a bug](#layer-2-metal)) when exported by the
game, but not by much. Position of EOF in an empty save is `332B`.

The first 4 bytes are dimensions of the layers.
They are `04 2C 04 1B`, representing the 44 (`2C`) columns of 27 (`1B`) elements.

The next 3 bytes appear to be layer markers found throughout the design data. They are `09 59 01`.

See [Layers](#layers).

By placing single squares of n-silicon in each corner, the following addresses in the save data are
determined:

- `000000EF` Top left
- `00000123` Bottom left
- `000008BA` Top right
- `000008EE` Bottom right

This suggests the following:

- Tiles are written in vertical strokes: from top-left, to bottom, then from left to right.
- The four user-uneditable columns on either side of the field are serialized in the design data,
even though they are never changed (the only exception being the [metal horizontal connection layer](#layer-8-metal-horizontal-connections),
4th column).
- The central 36 columns are user-editable.

# Layers

Layers are split up by markers as mentioned in [Format](#format). There appears to always be
9 layers in total. These layers include 2D data (in vertical columns top-bottom from left-right format).
Each column starts with the following bytes: `09 37 01`.

## Layer 1: Silicon

This layer has a length of `9CC` *((27 * 2 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 2-byte elements, making this layer at most twice as large as all other layers:

- `04 00` Empty
- `04 01` N Silicon
- `04 02` P Silicon

The purpose of the `04` bytes is currently unknown.

## Layer 2: Metal

This layer has a length of at least `528` *((27 + 3 + n) * 44)*, making this the only layer
observed to have a varying length.

Columns have at least 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` Empty
- `03` Metal

The cause of varying column size (*n*) is due to some elements of empty metal being written as
`04 00` instead of `02`. The cause of this is currently unknown. It may be caused by a bug when
exporting some designs in the game.

Instances of `04 00` in this layer can be safely replaced with `02`. Doing so will make all
uncompressed designs uniform in size, and re-encoding these changes will load perfectly fine in the
game.

## Layer 3: Vertical gate positions

These layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` No gate
- `03` Gate

The element with the connected value represents the position of the gate itself.
Consider the following gates:

```
- - P - -
- N X N -
- - - - -
- P X P -
- - N - -

N = N silicon
P = P silicon
X = "Gate" value 0x03
```

The direction of connection is determined in the silicon vertical connection layer.

There is no distiction between NPN and PNP gates.

## Layer 4: Horizontal gate positions

These layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` Empty
- `03` Gate

Similar to [Layer 3](#layer-3-vertical-gate-positions),
the element with the connected value represents the position of the gate itself.

The direction of connection is determined in the silicon horizontal connection layer.

There is no distiction between NPN and PNP gates.

## Layer 5: Vias

This layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` Empty
- `03` Via

## Layer 6: Silicon horizontal connections

This layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` No connection
- `03` Connected

The position of the connection in the layer represents a silicon tile with a connection to the
silicon tile to the right of it.

## Layer 7: Silicon vertical connections

This layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` No connection
- `03` Connected

The position of the connection in the layer represents a silicon tile with a connection to the
silicon tile underneath it.

## Layer 8: Metal horizontal connections

This layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` No connection
- `03` Connected

The position of the connection in the layer represents a metal tile with a connection to the
metal tile to the right of it.

## Layer 9: Metal vertical connections

This layers has a length of `528` *((27 + 3) * 44)*.

Columns have 27 1-byte elements:

- `02` No connection
- `03` Connected

The position of the connection in the layer represents a metal tile with a connection to the
metal tile underneath it.
